# Operating Systems Project - Matteo Franchini

This project was developed as an optional assignment for the Operating Systems course. It involves the implementation of six short-term scheduling algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms

The following algorithms have been implemented:

- **FCFS** (First-Come, First-Served)
- **SJF** (Shortest Job First)
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Round Robin (RR)**

In addition to the above algorithms, two additional algorithms were developed:

- **SRTF** (Shortest Remaining Time First)
- **Priority Scheduling with Round Robin**

## Configuration Files

For all algorithms, except for "Priority Scheduling with Round Robin," a configuration file named "config.txt" is used for input.

However, for the "Priority Scheduling with Round Robin" algorithm, a separate configuration file named "config_RR_priority.txt" was created, as there were no processes with equal priorities in the original "config.txt" file.

Please note that the project and its documentation are primarily written in Italian. This translation is provided for convenience, and it is recommended to refer to the original code and comments for precise details and instructions.
