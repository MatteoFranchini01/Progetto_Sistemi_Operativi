This project was developed as an optional assignment for the Operating Systems course. It involves the implementation of six short-\/term scheduling algorithms.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Implemented Algorithms}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
The following algorithms have been implemented\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{FCFS}} (First-\/\+Come, First-\/\+Served)
\item {\bfseries{SJF}} (Shortest Job First)
\item {\bfseries{Priority Scheduling}}
\item {\bfseries{Round Robin (RR)}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

In addition to the above algorithms, two additional algorithms were developed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{SRTF}} (Shortest Remaining Time First)
\item {\bfseries{Priority Scheduling with Round Robin}}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Configuration Files}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
For all algorithms, except for \char`\"{}\+Priority Scheduling with Round Robin,\char`\"{} a configuration file named \char`\"{}config.\+txt\char`\"{} is used for input.

However, for the \char`\"{}\+Priority Scheduling with Round Robin\char`\"{} algorithm, a separate configuration file named \char`\"{}config\+\_\+\+RR\+\_\+priority.\+txt\char`\"{} was created, as there were no processes with equal priorities in the original \char`\"{}config.\+txt\char`\"{} file.
